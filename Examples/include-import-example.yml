# All import* statements are pre-processed at the time playbooks are parsed.
# All include* statements are processed as they are encountered during the execution of the playbook.

# Breaking tasks up into different files is an excellent way to organize complex sets of tasks or reuse them. A task file simply contains a flat list of tasks:
# common_tasks.yml
- name: placeholder foo
  command: /bin/foo
- name: placeholder bar
  command: /bin/bar
# You can then use import_tasks or include_tasks to execute the tasks in a file in the main task list:
tasks:
- import_tasks: common_tasks.yml
# or
- include_tasks: common_tasks.yml
# You can also pass variables into imports and includes:
tasks:
- import_tasks: wordpress.yml
  vars:
    wp_user: timmy
- import_tasks: wordpress.yml
  vars:
    wp_user: alice
- import_tasks: wordpress.yml
  vars:
    wp_user: bob
